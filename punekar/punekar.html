            <p class="text">
                What makes a true Punekar? Is it not enough that you’re either born here, studied here and probably make a living too! We can’t
                be more proud of the city that is a melting pot of cultures, cuisines and art. There are gazillion things that make us a proud
                Punekar, but we have a curated list of the top 12 things that every Punekar has done or said atleast once. All you Puneri peeps,
                ready?
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Scarf It Up!</h2>
            
            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/scarfXd.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>
            
            <p class ="text">
                If you have a two-wheeler, then this is self-explanatory. A thing you’ll mostly see in Pune is women riding bikes with colourful
                scarves or stole wrapped around their face. It takes your eye-dentity to the next level; you see what we did there?
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Shopp Till You Dropped</h2>
            
            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/laxmi-road-pune-cropped-1529740242-1531740258.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>
            
            <p class="text">
                If you are a true Punekar, then you would have ventured into the colourful exhibit of clothing at Laxmi Road. Be it a wedding,
                party or any occasion that’s an excuse to shop; Laxmi Road has it all. That’s not all, they also have tonnes of shoes, belts and
                accessories to go along that stellar outfit. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Climbed This Fortress</h2>
            
            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/shutterstock-788932003-cropped-1531740332.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>
            
            <p class="text">
                The aan baan aur shaan of Pune, Sinhagad Fort (lion’s fort) that was built around 2000 years ago, is still standing strong 
                and our go-to spot for a trek all year round. Now, this popular tourist spot is a weekend destination for many city dwellers.
                No pleasure compares to eating a hot plate of kanda bhaji and a plate of the legendary-pitla bhakri. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Visited Shaniwar Wada</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/1200px-shaniwarwada-gate-cropped-1519730731-1531740407.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>
            
            <p class="text">
                If you’ve seen 'Bajirao Mastani', you’d already be familiar with the story. Shaniwar Wada is an unsaid monument
                mascot of Pune. This was the Peshwa’s residence, but due to a fire, the fort was destroyed and then refurbished to
                convert it into a tourist site that we know of now. If you’ve lived in Pune, you cannot have missed this one.
            </p>

            
            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Eaten at Bedekar Misal</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/untitled-design-1-1516271681bedekar-1531740454.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                This hole-the-wall joint is often debated if it deserves to be the best place in the city to hog on a plate of misal. 
                Given that it is one of the oldest spots in the city, we have a soft corner for it. Everyone has their own preference 
                when it comes to misal, but love it or hate it, as a true Punekar, you would have definitely eaten here at least once. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Can You Take A Joke?</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/puneri-patya-4-cropped-1531740699.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                If you have a sense of humour, the city does too! The ubiquitous signs called Puneri Patya, should not be taken lightly.
                Don’t be alarmed at the bluntness of the message; you need to take it in a light note. The patya culture has been thriving 
                in Pune dishing out advice, warnings and at times, threats to those who have not adopted the city’s culture
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Gotten Into A Fight/ Debate When It Comes To Defending Pune</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/main-qimg-536bbb48061d0d64176fce7738f58306-c-cropped-1531740805.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                We’re sure you’ve come across people from Mumbai who are confident that Mumbai is better than Pune on multiple levels. 
                But, if you have ever put anyone back in their place and defended Pune then, right on! 5416585 reasons to love Pune.
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">If You’ve Used Anyone Of These Words</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/8052428854-2fd24ee25b-b-cropped-1-1531740842.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                If you’ve lived in the city long enough, you would have picked up the language in no time. If you haven’t 
                been completely versed in the language, its okay, but we’re sure, you would have picked up on these few words 
                such as- lai bhaari, nako, aai shapat, barrr, aaiigaaa, vat lagli and more.
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">If You’re Corrected Someone Who’s Said ‘Poona’ Instead Of ‘Pune’</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/shutterstock-439098511-cropped-1531740881.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                We understand and acknowledge the city’s past, but it is what was formerly called Poona is now called Pune. 
                Before the era of Shivaji Maharaj, the city was called Punawadi, but it was the British that lent the name of 
                Poona. And in 1978 it was changed back to Pune. The word Pune comes from the confluence of two rivers, which is 
                called Punya. Here’s a little history lesson for you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Bought Books From ABC</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/abc-cropped-1531740930.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>

            <p class="text">
                We think we can go to the extent to say that most, if not all Punekars have bought textbooks, stationery or novels 
                from Appa Balwant Chowk. The place is always buzzing with second-hand books, book centres, printers and lots more
            </p>

            <h2 class="add-top-margin-small">Diwali Pahaat</h2>

            <div class="banner" style="background: url('/img/12771-3981349211536-1179079607-n-cropped-1531741160.jpg') no-repeat center; background-size: contain; height: 275px;"></div>
            
            <p class="text">
                On the festival of lights, city dwellers wake up in the wee hours of the morning, to get dressed up in their best outfits 
                and make their way to Saras Baugh to pay their respects and embrace the festival with thousand diyas and let go of evil while 
                lighting and releasing Chinese lanterns into the sky. A sight worth visiting, this sums up the culture, love and pride that runs
                in every Punekars veins.
